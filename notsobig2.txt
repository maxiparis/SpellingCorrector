scandal
in
bohemia
i
to
sherlock
holmes
she
is
always
the
woman
i
have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name
in
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex
it
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
irene
adler
all
emotions
and
that
one
particularly
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind
he
was
i
take
it
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen
but
as
a
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
a
false
position
he
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions
save
with
a
gibe
and
a
sneer
they
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer
excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men
s
motives
and
actions
but
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
a
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results
grit
in
a
sensitive
instrument
or
a
crack
in
one
of
his
own
high
power
lenses
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
a
strong
emotion
in
a
nature
such
as
his
and
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him
and
that
woman
was
the
late
irene
adler
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory
i
had
seen
little
of
holmes
lately
my
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other
my
own
complete
happiness
and
the
home
centred
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention
while
holmes
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
bohemian
soul
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
baker
street
buried
